# How to Participate in Governance

As a Stride liquid staker, you can participate in governance for both the Stride protocol and the chains where your tokens are staked.

## Stride Governance

### Viewing Proposals

1. Navigate to the **Governance** page
2. Browse active and past proposals
3. Click on any proposal to see full details

### Voting on Proposals

1. Go to the **Governance** page
2. Find an active proposal
3. Click **Vote**
4. Select your vote:
   - **Yes** — Support the proposal
   - **No** — Oppose the proposal
   - **No with Veto** — Strongly oppose (contributes to veto threshold)
   - **Abstain** — Participate without taking a position
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Proposal Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Text** | Signaling proposals with no on-chain execution |
| **Parameter Change** | Modify protocol parameters (fees, epochs, etc.) |
| **Software Upgrade** | Schedule a chain upgrade |
| **Community Spend** | Allocate funds from the community pool |

## Host Chain Governance

One unique feature of Stride is **governance passthrough**. When you liquid stake ATOM, you can still vote on Cosmos Hub governance proposals through Stride.

### How It Works

1. A governance proposal goes live on the Cosmos Hub
2. Stride creates a corresponding governance vote on Stride
3. stATOM holders vote on Stride
4. Stride aggregates votes and submits them to the Cosmos Hub on behalf of stakers

### Why This Matters

Without governance passthrough, liquid staked tokens would lose their governance power. Stride ensures that liquid stakers retain their voice in the networks they support.

## Best Practices

- **Stay informed** — Read proposal discussions before voting
- **Vote regularly** — Active participation strengthens the network
- **Consider delegation** — If you can't follow every proposal, delegate your vote
- **Engage in forums** — Join the Stride Discord and Commonwealth for governance discussions
