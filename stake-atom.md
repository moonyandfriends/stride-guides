# How to Stake ATOM with Stride

This guide walks you through liquid staking ATOM using the Stride protocol. By the end, you'll have stATOM in your wallet and be earning staking rewards.

## Prerequisites

- A Cosmos wallet (Keplr, Leap, or Cosmostation)
- ATOM tokens in your wallet
- A small amount of ATOM for transaction fees

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to the Stride app
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right corner
3. Select your wallet provider (Keplr recommended)
4. Approve the connection request in your wallet

## Step 2: Select ATOM

1. On the **Liquid Stake** page, find the token selector
2. Select **ATOM** from the dropdown
3. You'll see the current staking APY and exchange rate

## Step 3: Enter Amount

1. Enter the amount of ATOM you want to stake
2. Review the details:
   - **You will receive**: The amount of stATOM based on the current exchange rate
   - **Exchange rate**: Current ATOM → stATOM conversion rate
   - **APY**: Current staking annual percentage yield

## Step 4: Confirm Transaction

1. Click **Stake**
2. Review the transaction details in your wallet popup
3. Approve the transaction
4. Wait for confirmation (usually 15–30 seconds)

## Step 5: Verify Your stATOM

After the transaction confirms:

1. Check your wallet balance — you should see stATOM
2. Your stATOM will automatically accrue staking rewards
3. The value of your stATOM relative to ATOM will increase over time
