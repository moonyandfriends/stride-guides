# How to Earn Yield with stTokens

Liquid staking with Stride already earns you staking rewards, but you can earn additional yield by deploying your stTokens in DeFi. This guide covers the most popular strategies.

## Strategy 1: Provide Liquidity on Osmosis

The most popular way to earn additional yield with stTokens.

### Steps

1. Transfer stATOM to Osmosis via IBC
2. Navigate to the Osmosis DEX pools page
3. Find the **stATOM/ATOM** pool
4. Click **Add Liquidity**
5. Enter your desired amounts and confirm

### Expected Returns

- Staking rewards: ~15% APY (built into stATOM)
- LP rewards: ~5–10% APY (varies by pool incentives)
- **Combined: ~20–25% APY**

## Strategy 2: Lend on Mars Protocol

Use stTokens as collateral or lend them for additional yield.

### Steps

1. Navigate to Mars Protocol
2. Connect your wallet
3. Deposit stATOM into the lending market
4. Earn lending interest on top of staking rewards

## Strategy 3: Vault Strategies

Several DeFi protocols offer automated vault strategies:

- **Quasar** — automated LP management vaults
- **Sommelier** — intelligent DeFi strategy vaults

## Comparing Strategies

| Strategy | Additional APY | Risk Level | Complexity |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Hold stATOM | 0% | Low | None |
| LP on Osmosis | 5–10% | Medium | Low |
| Lend on Mars | 2–5% | Medium | Low |
| Vault strategies | 5–15% | Medium-High | Low |

## Important Considerations

- **Impermanent loss** — LP positions may experience IL if stATOM/ATOM ratio changes
- **Smart contract risk** — each additional protocol adds smart contract risk
- **Gas costs** — factor in transaction costs when calculating net returns
- **Lock-up periods** — some strategies may require bonding periods

## Tips

- Start with a small amount to test each strategy
- Diversify across multiple strategies to spread risk
- Monitor your positions regularly on the Analytics page
- Consider the total risk profile before maximizing yield
